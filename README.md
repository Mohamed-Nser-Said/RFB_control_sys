* ## Description 

   This project aims to provide a full operation system for a [redox flow battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_battery), the system will be controlled through a GUI,
  the GUI is built using python version of **Qt5**  [**pyside2**](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/index.html), the system consists of the cell itself, Shenchen Peristaltic Pump,
  [Keithley Instruments Model 2450](https://download.tek.com/manual/2450-900-01_D_May_2015_User_3.pdf) and
  [NI6001](http://deeea.urv.cat/deeea/images/laboratoris/manuals/ni_usb_6001_users_guide.pdf). the documentation will go through the basic connection of the hardware and the python code associated with it and the method that has been used, however it will not explain the technical part of the Redox Flow battery.
